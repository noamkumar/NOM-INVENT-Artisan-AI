## 2. Problem Statement

While government exhibitions (such as Shilp Samagam, Surajkund Mela, and Dilli Haat) offer crucial temporary exposure, rural micro-entrepreneurs and artisans lack continuous, year-round access to modern digital marketplaces. Transitioning to e-commerce is stalled by three core challenges:

* **Digital & Technical Friction:** E-commerce platforms demand studio-grade photography, typing-heavy onboarding, and fluent English SEO descriptions—creating insurmountable barriers for low-literacy, regional-language artisans.
* **Seasonal Sales Dependency:** Without year-round digital market exposure, artisans suffer from inconsistent income once physical fairs conclude.
* **Pricing Inefficiencies:** Lacking real-time market awareness and cost analysis, artisans frequently undervalue their craftsmanship or lose profits to predatory intermediaries.

**The Solution:** An intuitive, AI-driven mobile "virtual business manager" that breaks technical barriers by automating studio image editing, voice-based multilingual cataloging, and dynamic market pricing—empowering artisans to independently digitize and scale their inventory on global B2B and government e-marketplaces.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

KalaSetu compresses the entire digitization and e-commerce pipeline into **one photograph and one spoken sentence**:
- **Point & Shoot Studio:** An artisan takes a raw photo on any smartphone; a 10-stage computer vision pipeline strips cluttered backgrounds, corrects lighting, and outputs a square 1080×1080 studio asset.
- **Speak in Any Tongue:** The artisan narrates naturally in their regional language; domain-biased Whisper transcribes the voice note and generates a structured bilingual (English + Hindi) listing.
- **Inviolable Fair Price Floor:** The pricing engine calculates a strict non-negotiable cost floor (`Materials + Labor Hours × Fair Wage + Transport + Overhead`) combined with ChromaDB RAG market comparables, mathematically preventing algorithms from undercutting the artisan.
- **Offline-First Resilience:** Local Drift (SQLite) and Hive databases store all photos, audio notes, and drafts on the device, draining to the server automatically the moment connectivity returns.
- **Human in the Loop:** Every output (image, description, pricing) is read aloud via on-device bilingual TTS and requires the artisan's manual approval before going live.

---

## 4. Key Features

- **AI Image Studio:** 10-stage computer vision pipeline (rembg U²-Net, CLAHE illumination correction, auto-crop) turns phone snaps into e-commerce-ready assets.
- **Multilingual Voice Auto-Cataloger:** Artisans describe items in regional dialects; produces high-converting bilingual English + Hindi titles, descriptions, and SEO tags while strictly quarantining confidential cost numbers.
- **Dynamic Fair Pricing Engine:** Dual-layer pricing combining a mathematical cost floor with ChromaDB RAG retrieval over indexed market benchmarks (Amazon Karigar, FabIndia, Etsy, Okhai).
- **Offline-First Sync Engine:** Local Drift + Hive queue drains automatically when network connectivity resumes with exponential backoff.
- **KalaMitra Conversational Assistant:** Groq-powered multi-lingual assistant capable of executing voice actions (inventory filters, order lookups, scheme advisories).
- **Social Media Launchpad:** One-tap generated marketing copy with customized prompt templates for WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.
- **Orders & Packaging Advisory:** Packaging guidance and downloadable PDF shipping labels with ONDC-compatible profile QR codes.
- **Bilingual On-Device TTS:** Complete voice accessibility for non-literate artisans across every screen.
