## Future Scope

1. **Live ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) Integration**:
   - Implement full Beckn protocol BAP/BPP gateway connections for direct live marketplace cataloging, buyer-seller discovery, and automated order intake.

2. **Pan-India Multilingual & Dialect Expansion**:
   - Expand voice cataloging, LLM generation, and TTS beyond Hindi and English into 12+ Indic languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, Odia, Gujarati, Marathi, Assamese).
   - Fine-tune ASR biasing for regional craft dialects and localized heritage terminology (e.g., *Ikat*, *Kalamkari*, *Dhokra*, *Bidriware*).

3. **Augmented Reality (AR) Product Visualizer**:
   - WebAR and mobile AR support allowing prospective domestic and international buyers to view 3D scale models of pottery, handicrafts, and brassware in their physical living space.

4. **Micro-Credit & Working Capital Integration (FinTech Linkage)**:
   - Use verified artisan catalog volume and sales velocity to generate alternative credit scores for collateral-free micro-loans through OCEN and government initiatives (PM SVANidhi, Mudra Yojana).

5. **Production Cloud Hardening & Push Services**:
   - Transition media storage from local filesystem to S3 / Cloudflare R2 with CDN acceleration.
   - Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications and establish Alembic database schema migrations.
